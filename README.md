# Salamunalaikum ðŸ‘‹

Technology excites me and I am always in awe of the change it drives in the world. Skills that I have worked with include DSA (Java), Frontend (ReactJs + NextJs). And now, I'm actively engaged in acquiring proficiency in backend development (Node). And what I might lack in skills I make up for with my determination to learn.

I have a Bachelor's degree in IT from SBBU SBA. The reason behind choosing for its transformative impact on the world.

Outside of tech, I am an avid bird lover, enjoying playing badminton and competing in FIFA.
