# Salamunalaikum ðŸ‘‹

With hands-on experience in both frontend (React.js, Next.js) and backend (Node.js) development, I specialize in crafting seamless digital experiences.

Currently, Iâ€™m diving deep into the world of cloud with AWS, aiming to master the art of bringing scalable, robust solutions to life.

I have a Bachelor's degree in IT from SBBU SBA. The reason behind choosing this domain for its transformative impact on the world.

Outside the world of development, I am an avid bird lover, enjoying playing badminton and competing in FIFA.

Technologies I love to work with are REACT, NODE (EXPRESS), POSTGRES, and AWS.
