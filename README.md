# Salamunalaikum ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a backend engineer with production-grade experience.

I develop high-performance REST and GraphQL APIs using Django (DRF) with a core stack that includes PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching, Celery for background task processing, and WebSockets for real-time communication.

On the AI side, I build agentic solutions using LangGraph, RAG, and MCP, making technology smarter, adaptive, and capable of automating complex tasks.

For deployments and infrastructure, I primarily work with AWS (EC2, S3, RDS) and Cloudflare (R2). I also use Render when lightweight, fast deployments are needed. 

Docker and Git keep my delivery process smooth and reliable.

To me, backend engineering isnâ€™t just about writing code, itâ€™s about designing resilient systems that power products and grow with scale.

Outside of engineering, youâ€™ll probably find me diving into car reviews or competing in FIFA.
