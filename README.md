# Hey Folk's ðŸ‘‹

Trying to make "Hello World" into Masterful Code;

Technology excites me and I am always in awe of the change it drives in the world. Certain skills that I have worked with include DSA (Java), Web Development (ReactJs), and Hybrid Mobile Development (React Native). And what I might lack in skills I make up for with my determination to learn.

I have a Bachelor's degree in IT from SBBU SBA. The reason behind choosing for its transformative impact on the world.

Outside of tech, I am an avid bird lover, enjoying playing badminton and competing in FIFA.
